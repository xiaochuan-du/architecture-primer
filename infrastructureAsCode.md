# Infrastructure As Code (IAC)

## Tools

- [Chef](https://www.chef.io/)
- [Puppet](https://puppet.com/)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
- [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/)
- [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)



### Comparison

#### Configuration Management vs Orchestration

configuration management, install and manage software on existing servers

- Chef
- Puppet
- Ansible
- SaltStack 

orchestration tools: provision the servers themselves.

- CloudFormation
- Terraform 

Using docker or packer makes it less necessary to leverage configuration management tools.

#### Mutable Infrastructure vs Immutable Infrastructure

Immutable Infrastructure (Terraform, cloudformation) is better because it can avoid "configuration drift"



#### Procedural vs Declarative

Declarative (Terraform, CloudFormation, SaltStack, and Puppet) method highlights the final conditions

When dealing with procedural code

- the state of the infrastructure is *not* fully captured in the code, eg order
- The reusability of procedural code is inherently limited because you have to manually to take into account the current state of the codebase.

Declarative:

- creating generic, reusable code can be tricky 
- expressive power is limited

**Terraform** uses cloud provider APIs to provision infrastructure, so there are no new authentication mechanisms beyond what youâ€™re using with the cloud provider already, and there is no need for direct access to your servers. We found this as the best option in terms of ease-of-use, security, and maintainability.

Ansible over ssh, and cloudformation uses hosted server.



#### Conclusion

Teeraform is better since it is cloud-agnostic. [Tutorial](https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c)
