# Data Visualization

Why it is important?

- 越来越多的决定是数据驱动的。Eg，炒股票以前凭感觉，凭交易所门口大妈的报纸。现在看指标市盈率、换手率、大股东持有时间。
- 数据越来越多，大家都是非常熟悉2007年以后我们能够接触到的数据都是爆炸式的增长。
- 人理解数据的习惯更偏向于从图表中获取知识而不是从报表中，资产负债表没有K线图来的直观。
- 对于输血来说同样是有很多指标需要监控，我们关心A型血申红量的变化趋势、我们也关心患者在输血治疗前后血常规指标的变动，对变化趋势的追踪能够帮助我们作出库存管理策略的更新、工作进度的安排、科研热点的选择。

Let’s say you need to understand thousands or even millions of rows of data, and you have a short time to do it in. 

The data may come from your team, in which case perhaps you’re already familiar with what it’s measuring and what the results are likely to be. Or it may come from another team, or maybe several teams at once, and be completely unfamiliar. Either way, the reason you’re looking at it is that you **have a decision to make, and you want to be informed by the data before making it**. Something probably hangs in the balance: a customer, a product, or a profit.

**How are you going to make sense of all that information efficiently so you can make a good decision? Data visualization is an important answer to that question.**



The best data visualizations are ones that *expose something new* about the underlying patterns and relationships contained within the data. 



Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is easier than poring over spreadsheets or reports. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner – and you can experiment with different scenarios by making slight adjustments.

Data visualization can also:

- Identify areas that need attention or improvement.
- Clarify which factors influence customer behavior.
- Help you understand which products to place where.
- Predict sales volumes.



Today more than ever, professionals are being asked to argue their cases and make their decisions based on data,” he says. “A new, data-oriented mind-set is permeating the business world.”



non-technical professionals must now produce and comprehend insights from Big Data.
